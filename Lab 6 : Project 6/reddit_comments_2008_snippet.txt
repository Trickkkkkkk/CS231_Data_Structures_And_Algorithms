&gt;I need to print up a pamphlet of facts that can disconnect people from their trust of government.

As a very wise, successful union organizer named Al Evanoff taught me, when I had a similar impulse,

"Paper doesn't organize people. People organize people."

It turned out to be some of the best advice I ever heard. Believe it: NOTHING takes the place of face-to-face organizing. There are no shortcuts. But when long-term, serous organizing works right, each one you reach in turn reaches another, and so on and so on.
Is there any better time to start than now?
its the adrenalin, can you imagine the excitement there, well i cant but looks interesting :)
